# WeatherAgent App

WeatherAgent App is a sleek, AI-powered chat interface that delivers real-time weather reports using a streaming API. Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, this application offers users an interactive and responsive way to get up-to-date weather information through natural conversation.

# Live Demo

# Features
1) Chat Interface – Chat with a smart weather agent in real-time.
2) Streaming API Integration – Responses are streamed live for faster, more dynamic interactions.
3) Accurate Weather Reports – Get weather data based on cities, countries, or custom locations.
4) Responsive UI – Clean and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
5) Real-time Feedback – Messages appear instantly as they’re generated by the AI.

# Known Limitations
Some features are under development and may not work as expected:
 1) Chat History – Previous messages are not stored or retrieved yet.
 2) Dark/Light Mode Toggle – Theme toggle button is in place but switching doesn’t work yet.
 3) Share Button – Share UI is visible, but clicking it currently does nothing.
